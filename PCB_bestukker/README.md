# PCB_bestukker.

## CONTENT
	This is the project for the course *beeldinterpretatie*. The purpose is to give an empty PCB image and let an algorithm place the components on the print. At this moments it's only coded for resistors. In another project (*Polarisation_detection*) there's a POC for detecting the polarisation side of a diode. Also, a ROI cutter project was coded. This was to easily create one or multiple templates.

## HOW TO RUN:
	Go to the path `"/PCB_bestukker/bin/Debug/"` and run `./PCB_bestukker -i=../../img/pcb_2.png -j=../../img/template_R_pcb2.png -k=../../img/template_D_pcb2.png`
